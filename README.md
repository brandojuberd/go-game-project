# Go Game Project

## Description
----------
A super mini project, it's a project where I learn Go language. I start by learning how to define a data types, map, slices, struct, and functions. Programming paradigm on Go language actually quite different compared to Javascript, Go mainly have functional programming. Yes, it is supports class-like object but it only capable to do composition characteristics of OOP.
